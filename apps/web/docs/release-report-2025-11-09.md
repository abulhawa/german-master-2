# Release Checklist Execution — 2025-11-09

## Summary
- `npm run db:push` and `npm run seed` failed immediately because the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not configured in this environment. No database changes were applied.
- `npm run test:unit` (via `npm run test:all`) completed successfully after running 116 tests across 37 files.
- Playwright end-to-end tests initially failed because browsers were not installed. After installing Chromium with `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`, all 7 E2E tests passed.
- `npm run check` (TypeScript compile) finished without errors.
- `FORCE_ENV_VALIDATION=1 npm run validate:env` succeeded with production values set for Supabase Auth, `APP_ORIGIN`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`. Output recorded in `docs/deployment/production-env-validation-2025-11-09.log`.

## Detailed Command Output

### `npm run db:push`
- Failure: `DATABASE_URL is not configured. Set a connection string before using the database client.`

### `npm run seed`
- Failure: `DATABASE_URL is not configured. Set a connection string before using the database client.`

### `npm run test:all`
- `npm run test:unit`: 116 tests passed across 37 files (97.16s total).
- `npm run test:e2e`: 7 tests passed (27.4s total) after installing Playwright browsers.

### `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`

### `npm run check`
- Completed successfully with no diagnostics.

### `FORCE_ENV_VALIDATION=1 npm run validate:env`
- Passed with production equivalents for Supabase Auth, `APP_ORIGIN`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`.
- Command output archived in `docs/deployment/production-env-validation-2025-11-09.log` for release traceability.

## Outstanding Requirements / Blocks
- A valid `DATABASE_URL` (and associated credentials) is required to execute `npm run db:push` and `npm run seed` successfully. Provide connection details for the target PostgreSQL instance before rerunning these steps.
- Deployment to staging/production could not be attempted because required access credentials and deployment tooling were not supplied.
- Smoke tests against critical endpoints were not run because the application was not deployed to a reachable staging/production environment.
- Pipeline output has been captured in this document for traceability. No additional archival location was specified.
