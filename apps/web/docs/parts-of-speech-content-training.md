# Content Training Deck – Parts-of-Speech Expansion

> Use this outline as a slide deck for onboarding content editors to the lexeme-based workflow. Each `## Slide` heading represents one slide.

## Slide 1 – Why the change?
- Verb-only infrastructure blocked expansion into nouns and adjectives.
- New lexeme schema + task registry supports mixed POS sessions and deterministic queues.
- Editors now help steward lexeme metadata that powers both online and offline experiences.

## Slide 2 – Key concepts
- **Lexeme**: approved lemma + POS + metadata; deterministic ID (e.g., `de:noun:Kind:wx3af912`).
- **Inflection**: surface form + morphological features linked to a lexeme.
- **Task spec**: prompt/solution pair bound to a lexeme and task type (e.g., `noun_case_declension`).

## Slide 3 – Daily workflow overview
1. Pull latest `main` and install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run seed` to refresh lexeme inventories and QA fixtures.
3. Open `/admin` to review candidate entries (filters by POS, level, completeness).
4. Edit entries inline; reseed if you adjust approval flags or metadata.
5. Spot-check offline bundle export/import flows before handing off to QA.

## Slide 4 – Authoring guidelines
- Populate translations, CEFR level, and usage examples for every lexeme.
- Verbs require auxiliary, Präteritum, Partizip II, and Perfekt fields.
- Nouns must include gender and plural; adjectives need comparative and superlative forms.
- Use `sourceNotes` for attribution/URL trails; keep `sourcesCsv` synced with upstream dataset identifiers.

## Slide 5 – QA checklist
- Confirm regenerated lexeme/task snapshots match the expected CEFR coverage and counts.
- Spot-check offline bundles by exporting/importing practice data to ensure prompts/solutions render as expected.
- Confirm every POS surfaces the expected tasks before sign-off.
- Record any import/export issues with file paths and share during standup.

## Slide 6 – Launch readiness signals
- `/api/tasks` returns healthy mixes for each POS from seeded content.
- Practice logs in `practice_history` show attempts across verbs, nouns, and adjectives.
- Playwright smoke tests pass for mixed-mode sessions.
- Training materials (this deck + admin guide) are acknowledged by the content team.

## Slide 7 – Support & escalation
- Engineering contact: Platform team (#lexeme-expansion channel).
- File issues in the `parts-of-speech` project board for schema or renderer bugs.
- Document dataset anomalies in `docs/verb-corpus/` or create a new note under `docs/external/`.
- Share learnings and queue review notes in weekly content syncs.
