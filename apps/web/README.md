# German Master

German Master is a full-stack, lexeme-centric practice platform for German learners. It ships with a multi-part-of-speech task registry covering verbs, nouns, and adjectives, a React-based client that renders tasks by `taskType`, and an Express API backed by Drizzle ORM. The app can be installed as a Progressive Web App and works fully offline thanks to deterministic task packs seeded at build time.

## Local setup

Requires Node.js 22.0.0 or newer and npm 10+ (see `package.json` engines field).

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. (Optional) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and override the defaults. You can change:

   - `DATABASE_URL` – Postgres connection string (e.g. Supabase or local `postgres://` URL).
   - `DATABASE_SSL` / `PGSSLMODE` – set to `disable` when connecting to a local instance without TLS.
   - `APP_ORIGIN` – a comma-separated allow list used for CORS. Required in production; development falls back to localhost origins when unset.
   - `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` – Supabase project used by the server to verify web auth tokens.
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` – the same Supabase project exposed to the browser for Supabase Auth.
   - Google OAuth is configured in Supabase Auth; use the same Supabase project as Android to preserve mobile history.
   - `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` / `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` – optional credentials for Microsoft OAuth sign-in.
   - `ENABLE_LEXEME_SCHEMA` – disable to fall back to the legacy verb-only stack (defaults to `true`).
3. Apply the latest migrations to your Postgres database:

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
4. Seed the content tables and regenerate deterministic task packs used by the offline cache:

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
5. Start the development server (Express API + Vite dev server):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm run dev:client # start only the Vite dev server on port 5000 for UI smoke tests
   ```

   When `DATABASE_URL` is unset the `npm run dev` script now enables an in-memory Postgres mock. The server applies the latest
   Drizzle migrations and seeds a small enrichment fixture so admin screens and task APIs are reachable without provisioning a
   real database. Set `USE_DEV_DB_MOCK=0` to opt out when you want to exercise a live Postgres instance locally.
6. Additional scripts:

   ```bash
   npm run check      # type-check the project
   npm run build      # create production bundles and server output
   npm run validate:env # ensure production env vars are present before building
   npm run test:unit  # run unit and integration tests with Vitest
   npm run test:all   # run all Vitest checks
   npm run packs:lint # validate generated content packs against the task registry
   npm run db:reset   # drop all Postgres objects and clear generated data (preserves data/pos)
   ```

Point the backend at any Postgres instance (local Docker, Supabase, etc.) via `DATABASE_URL`. The driver enables SSL by default so managed providers just work; override `DATABASE_SSL=disable` or `PGSSLMODE=disable` for plain-text local development.

## Deployment

### Environment variables

Before running `npm run db:push` or `npm run seed` in any managed environment, set the same variables documented in `.env.example`:

- `DATABASE_URL` (required) – Postgres connection string for the production database.
- `DATABASE_SSL` / `PGSSLMODE` (optional) – leave unset to negotiate TLS automatically or set to `disable` when targeting a local database without SSL.
- `APP_ORIGIN` (required in production) – comma-separated allow list of trusted origins that should be able to hit the production API. Development builds fall back to `http://localhost` / `http://127.0.0.1` ports used by Vite.
- `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` – Supabase project used by the server to verify web auth tokens.
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` – the same Supabase project exposed to the browser for Supabase Auth.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` – Resend production API key used to deliver verification and password reset emails.
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` – verified sender (e.g. `German Master <no-reply@example.com>`). Defaults to Resend's sandbox sender when omitted.
- Google OAuth is configured in Supabase Auth; use the same Supabase project as Android so web Google login resolves to the same Supabase user ID and preserves practice history.
- `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` / `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` – optional Microsoft OAuth credentials.
- `ENABLE_ADMIN_FEATURES` – toggles admin-only APIs and the `/admin` dashboard (defaults to `true` outside production, `false` in production).
- `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (optional) – required when admin features are enabled to authenticate ingestion tools targeting `/api/admin/*` routes.
- `ENABLE_LEXEME_SCHEMA` – opt-in toggle that keeps the multi-POS stack enabled when generating packs.

These must be present both in Vercel’s Environment Variables UI and in any CI job that invokes the migration (`npm run db:push`) and seeding (`npm run seed`) scripts so the Drizzle client connects with the correct SSL options.

Run `npm run validate:env` (or let `npm run build` invoke it automatically) to fail fast when any required production value is missing or pointed at a placeholder. Vercel builds abort early when the script reports missing configuration, preventing partially configured deployments.

### Build output

`npm run build` emits two deployable artifacts:

1. Static client assets in `dist/public/` (generated by Vite).
2. An ESM server bundle in `dist/index.js` plus the exported API handlers under `server/api` (bundled by esbuild).

On Vercel, configure the project to run `npm install`, `npm run db:push`, `npm run seed`, and `npm run build` as the build step. Point the “Output Directory” at `dist/public` so static assets are uploaded automatically, and map `/api/*` routes to the bundled handler (see `server/api/vercel-handler.ts`) via the existing `vercel.json` configuration.

### Task-spec refresh

Task specs refresh automatically when the app serves task requests. The API calls the synchronizer through `ensureTaskSpecCacheFresh()`, using `task_sync_state` as the checkpoint so normal app traffic keeps generated queues current without a separate admin cron job.

### Provisioning Supabase

1. Follow the Supabase “Get started with Postgres” guide to [create a new project and database](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview).
2. In the project dashboard, open **Project Settings → Database → Connection string** and copy the **URI** variant; this becomes `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Still under **Project Settings → Database**, expand **SSL configuration** and enable client certificate access if required. Supabase exposes certificates compatible with the `rejectUnauthorized: false` fallback used by `db/client.ts`, so you can paste the full connection string directly. If you enforce strict SSL, supply the CA bundle and configure `DATABASE_SSL` with the appropriate JSON per the [Supabase SSL instructions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting/ssl). The client automatically relaxes TLS when `DATABASE_SSL=disable` or `PGSSLMODE=disable` in development.

### Quick Postgres sandbox

Spin up a disposable Postgres container for local development or manual testing:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --name gvm-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  postgres:16

export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/postgres
npm run db:push
npm run seed

# (optional) point the Vitest harness at the container instead of pg-mem
export TEST_DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL
# disable SSL for the local container (pg-mem stays the default when unset)
export TEST_DATABASE_SSL=disable
npm test
```

Shut down the container with `docker stop gvm-postgres` when you are done.

## Testing

- `npm test` (aliased to `npm run test:unit`) executes the Vitest suites. API tests no longer boot an ad-hoc Express app; they call the Vercel-style handler exported from `server/api/vercel-handler.ts` using fetch-driven mocks from `tests/helpers/vercel.ts`.
- `tests/helpers/pg.ts` provides an isolated Postgres harness backed by [`pg-mem`](https://github.com/oguimbal/pg-mem). Each suite applies the real Drizzle migrations from `migrations/` and installs the test data by mocking `db/client.ts`, so no external database is required to run the suites in CI or locally.
- To run the suites against a real Postgres instance, export `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (and optionally `TEST_DATABASE_SSL=disable` for local containers). The helper will wipe the `public` + `drizzle` schemas before and after the test run, apply migrations, and reuse the live pool instead of pg-mem.
- For manual verification against a live Postgres instance, point `DATABASE_URL` at your sandbox (see above) and use `npm run db:push` followed by `npm run seed` to hydrate tables before hitting the API through the Vercel handler or Express dev server.

## Release checklist

1. `npm run db:push`
2. `npm run seed`
3. `npm run test:all`
4. Deploy the build and smoke-test `/api/tasks`.

## Theme system

- Global color tokens live in `client/src/index.css`. Light and dark palettes share the same variable names (`--bg`, `--fg`, `--accent`, etc.), so components only reference semantic utilities such as `bg-card`, `text-fg`, and `ring-accent`.
- Accent usage is intentionally small: primary buttons, selected states, focus rings, and toggled controls. Most surfaces rely on muted neutrals for both themes.
- The header now includes a theme toggle that persists the selection (`light`, `dark`, or `system`) in `localStorage` and respects the system preference when `system` is active. The helper logic lives in `client/src/lib/theme.ts`.

## Lexeme-based task system

- `/api/tasks` exposes POS-aware task descriptors driven by the shared registry in `shared/task-registry.ts` and server metadata in `server/tasks/registry.ts`.
- Legacy verb routes have been removed. Clients should rely on `/api/tasks` for fetching practice prompts and `/api/submission` for recording attempts.
- The deterministic schema covers `lexemes`, `inflections`, `task_specs`, and `practice_history`. These tables live alongside legacy verb tables until shadow mode validates parity.

## Progressive Web App

- The client is bundled with `vite-plugin-pwa` using an auto-updating service worker.
- `client/public/manifest.webmanifest` defines install metadata, icons, and standalone display mode.
- Runtime caching keeps `/api/tasks` responses available offline so the most recent prompts persist between sessions without bundling static packs.
- A `virtual:pwa-register` hook registers the service worker on load; the app earns an 80+ Lighthouse PWA score when built.

## Offline + Sync

- Task data is fetched from `/api/tasks` when online and cached by the service worker for offline reuse.
- Practice attempts are written to an IndexedDB queue (via Dexie) whenever the network is unavailable or the API is rate limited.
- The `useSyncQueue` hook listens to `online` and `visibilitychange` events and flushes queued attempts back to `POST /api/submission`.
- Each device receives a persistent `deviceId` stored in `localStorage`; it is sent with every practice submission and stored in `practice_history` for future analytics.
- `data/pos/*.jsonl` contains the POS-specific seed files (verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, …). Each line is a JSON object that includes lemma metadata, an `approved` flag, an `examples` array of German/English pairs, and POS-specific attributes.
- Legacy aggregated CSVs now live under `data/legacy/` for historical reference. The new seeding pipeline reads the POS-specific files directly and regenerates task specs in Postgres on every `npm run seed`.

## Database utilities

- The schema is managed with Drizzle + Postgres. After editing `db/schema.ts`, run `npm run db:push` to apply migrations using the configured `DATABASE_URL`.
- `npm run seed` recomputes completeness, writes deterministic task specs through the template registry, and idempotently upserts source material into Postgres. Run the seed after editing any `data/pos/*.jsonl` file or adjusting enrichment snapshots under `data/enrichment/`.
- The seeding pipeline synchronises the shared `lexemes`/`inflections` tables for every part of speech and records aggregated attribution metadata alongside each task so CC BY-SA contributors are always credited.

## Vocabulary enrichment helpers

- Run `npm run enrich` to execute the enrichment pipeline. By default it inspects incomplete entries (`ONLY_INCOMPLETE=true`), queries Kaikki's Wiktextract dataset, OpenThesaurus, MyMemory, Tatoeba, and optionally OpenAI (`ENABLE_AI=true`) for missing metadata, and writes a structured report under `data/generated/enrichment/`. Set `APPLY_UPDATES=true` to upsert the suggested `english`/example values back into Postgres after taking a JSON backup (`data/generated/backups/words-backup-*.json`). Use `COLLECT_WIKTEXTRACT=false` to disable the Wiktextract integration when debugging network behaviour.
- Wiktextract responses now flow into `words.pos_attributes`: governed cases, Kaikki usage notes, and POS-level tags (e.g. _separable_, _transitive_, _two-way preposition_) are merged with any existing metadata so noun/adjective/preposition cohorts accumulate the descriptors needed for the multi-POS rollout.
- Every provider snapshot is also persisted under `data/enrichment/<pos>/<provider>.json` so Kaikki/Wiktextract, MyMemory, Tatoeba, OpenThesaurus, and OpenAI responses remain source-of-truth across schema changes. The seeding script loads these files and replays their translations, examples, verb forms, and enrichment metadata back into Postgres to keep approved words intact. When `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `ENRICHMENT_SUPABASE_BUCKET` are configured the same payloads are uploaded to Supabase Storage for off-site backups.
- See [docs/enrichment-persistence.md](docs/enrichment-persistence.md) for details on where enrichment data lives and how to export the latest applied provider snapshots with `npm run enrichment:export`.
- `LIMIT=<n>`, `CANONICAL_MODE=<pending|approved|all>` (legacy values `non-canonical|canonical|all` are still accepted), `DELAY_MS=<ms>`, and `OVERWRITE_EXISTING=true` fine-tune batch size, target scope, rate limiting, and whether existing translations/examples may be replaced.
- `POS_FILTERS=N,Adj` (comma/space separated) narrows the run to specific parts of speech so noun/adjective backfills can be validated without touching the verb catalog.
- Use `tsx scripts/enrich-pending-words.ts` for quick exports to `data/generated/pending-approval-enrichment.json` without mutating the database.

## Lexeme & content admin tools

- When admin tooling is enabled, configure an `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` in your `.env` file (see `.env.example`) to protect ingestion routes. Restart the dev server after changing environment variables.
- Visit `http://localhost:5000/admin` to access the words dashboard. Multi-select filters now support verbs, nouns, adjectives, and CEFR levels for quick targeting.
- Updates are issued via `PATCH /api/words/:id` with the `x-admin-token` header. Approval toggles and field edits immediately invalidate the admin cache and prompt the next `npm run seed` to refresh lexeme rows, inflections, and task specs.

## Task delivery

- Practice tasks are served directly from `task_specs` using the latest content updates; no device-level Leitner state is required.
- Submissions written to `/api/submission` are stored in `practice_history` alongside minimal metadata so analytics can be layered on later if needed.

## Microsoft OAuth example (Express)

Use the built-in `/auth/microsoft` routes when you want a minimal, framework-agnostic OAuth 2.0 flow backed by your own `.env` values:

```bash
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=...
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI=https://mydomain.com/auth/microsoft/callback
SESSION_SECRET=super-secret-hmac-key
```

- `GET /auth/microsoft` redirects to Microsoft’s authorization page using the v2.0 consumer endpoints.
- `GET /auth/microsoft/callback` exchanges the `code`, fetches the OpenID user profile, normalises it to `{ id, email, name, picture }`, and issues a signed session token you can replace with your own persistence strategy.
- Helper functions such as `buildMicrosoftAuthURL`, `exchangeCodeForToken`, and `fetchMicrosoftUser` live in `server/routes/microsoft-oauth.ts` with inline comments explaining each step.
- Frontend trigger:

```html
<button onclick="window.location.href='/auth/microsoft'">
  Sign in with Microsoft
</button>
```
